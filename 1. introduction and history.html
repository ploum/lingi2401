#History of free software
To put a bit of context

This guy had modified the software on the previous printer so you were notified when your print was done (because most people worked on a different floor than the printer). He realised he could not do it anymore with the new printer because the software was copyrighted and no source code were available.

#Free Software philosophy
- People should be free
- So software should be free too
- So non-free software are unethical
- Software is not the meal, it's the recipe
---
class: center, middle
#Free as in free speech
- Free to use
- Free to study
- Free to modify
- Free to redistribute
---
class: center, middle
# What is freedom?
Free to use your own definition of freedom

???
My personal take: free to use means that it should be usable. Something that is not user-friendly enough (for instance) is not very free to use in a certain way.

    From: torvalds@klaava.Helsinki.FI (Linus Benedict Torvalds)
    Newsgroups: comp.os.minix
    Subject: What would you like to see most in minix?
    Summary: small poll for my new operating system
    Message-ID: <1991Aug25.205708.9541@klaava.Helsinki.FI>
    Date: 25 Aug 91 20:57:08 GMT
    Organization: University of Helsinki

    Hello everybody out there using minix –

    I’m doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won’t be big and
    professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones. This has been brewing
    since april, and is starting to get ready. I’d like any feedback on
    things people like/dislike in minix, as my OS resembles it somewhat
    (same physical layout of the file-system (due to practical reasons)
    among other things).

    I’ve currently ported bash(1.08) and gcc(1.40), and things seem to work.
    This implies that I’ll get something practical within a few months, and
    I’d like to know what features most people would want. Any suggestions
    are welcome, but I won’t promise I’ll implement them 🙂

    Linus (torvalds@kruuna.helsinki.fi)

    PS. Yes – it’s free of any minix code, and it has a multi-threaded fs.
    It is NOT protable (uses 386 task switching etc), and it probably never
    will support anything other than AT-harddisks, as that’s all I have :-(.

# Free Software vs Open Source
- Free software because it's better for humans, even if software are less good.
- Open source because it's better for software development.

- Free software won't compromise. Non-free software are to be avoided.
- Open source looks for compromises and may even help proprietary software.

Still ongoing war of terms; in practice and for most people, it refers to the same thing.
