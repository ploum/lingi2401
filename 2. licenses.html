Let's try to define the concept together and reach a definition.

#Let's put things in context

#Sybaris Law
VIth century AD

???
First law about immaterial property, for recipes inventors (1 year). Before that, we don't have occurence of immaterial property. Does it even have a sense ?

#Rival goods vs Non-rival goods

Economical concept.

#The printing press

#The copyright

???
At first: the king chose who had the right to print books, in order to censor it.
NB : the copyright is a censorship tool and was never designed to help the authors. It created a set of intermediaries which had plenty of power. The tool is for the intermediaries only.

#Boléro de Ravel
Détentrice des droits en 2016 : la fille, issue d'un premier mariage, de la seconde femme du mari de la masseuse du frère de Maurice Ravel

???
Maurice Ravel meurt en 1937. Son seul héritier est son frère, Édouard. Celui-ci est victime d'un accident de voiture avec sa femme et a besoin d'une masseuse. La masseuse s'installe au domicile et son mari devient chauffeur du couple. La masseuse est héritière testamentaire. Elle organise son divorce pour se marier avec Édouard afin qu'on ne puisse pas discuter l'héritage. Mais Édouard meurt avant le mariage. Elle se remarie donc avec son mari. Avant de mourir. Le mari, ex-chauffeur, est donc le titulaire des droits du Boléro. S'ensuit 20 ans de procès avec des arrières petits-cousins de Maurice Ravel, subitement débarqués de Suisse, qui prétendent détenir les droits. Ils perdent. L'ancien chauffeur se remarie avant de mourir. Sa nouvelle femme avait une fille d'un premier mariage qui est la dernière héritière de Ravel, au moment où les droits tombent dans le domaine public, 70 ans après la mort de l'auteur. Le tout est principalement perçu par une société offshore qui a été montée par l'ancien directeur de la SACEM, qui a démissionné lorsqu'il a vu que le procès prenait une bonne tournure afin de devenir conseiller d'un seul client (l'ex-chauffeur). Notons que les héritiers du directeur de ballet et du chef décorateur ayant travaillé avec Ravel ont tenté d'empêcher l'élévation du Boléro dans le domaine public sous prétexte que c'était une œuvre commune.

# Code is writing
- Copyright applies like any artistic creation
- Copyright is immediate (you only have to prove the creation time unlike patents and trademarks)

---
class: center, middle

# Patents
- No software patents in EU
- In theory…

- Abstract ideas and algorithms are, in theory, unprotectable
- Programming languages are not protectable
- UX is a graphical creation

#Who's the author?

- Agreement between contributors, each is author of his/her lines
- Economic rights are usually transferred to the employer
- Authors keep their moral rights
- Diffusion under a given license is an economic right


???
One of the moral right is that each contributor have the right to see his name listed amongst the contributors.

#When there's no employer?
- Open Source projects usually have Contributor Agreements
- Not really needed when there's no doubt about the intention of the contributor

???
For big projects, every contributor must sign a contributor agreement

class: center, middle

#License

"A license is a contract between the provider of the software and the user"
???
The provider is not the author but the one who have the economic right. In many cases, that is the employer.
---
class: center, middle

#Each software could have its own license
- But standardisation helps to clarify the use
- Software distributors are not lawyers
- A license might be illegal and thus invalid (hence the test in court)

???
If a license is tested as invalid in court, nobody can enforces it anymore

class: center, middle

#How to license a software?

???
Answer : you have to make sure that the user was informed of the license and could read it. That's why you often have those "I agree" boxes.

#Tivo and Tivoisation
- GPL version 3
- GPL v2+

???
Tivo was a television recorder using a modified linux in 2006. Source were distributed but a chip only allowed the orignial code to run. Thus, you could not run any modification of the code. Linus Torvalds doesn't care while, for stallman, this was unacceptable. GPLv3 prevents that.
2+ means that any subsequent version is accepted
