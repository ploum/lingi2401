#Create a software
- Name?
- Use?
- Target users?
- Selling point?
- Distribution model?
- Business model?

???
Choose your license accordingly. Proprietary licenses are fine.

Take into account the initial developement time and the maintenance, including new versions.

"Every system that needs money will have a strong tendancy to maximise money without consideration for anything else."

#Wikipedia, Framasoft
- Donations only
- Patreon, Tipeee, Flattr, Liberapay, OpenCollective

???
The donation business model can be creatively exploited. The Sublime text editor, for example, use an "infinite trial version" to encourage you to buy a definitive version. The author, on his blog, use the term "free price" which has been popularized as "prix libre".

Many donation platforms have appeared: Patreon and Tipeee, for monthly recurring donations, Flattr, very original but currently evolving, Liberapay for weekly recurring donation with a special focus on free software or Open Collective.

#ICO
- Initial Coin Offering
- Mostly for blockchain related projects
- Makes sense only if a token makes sense in the project
- Currently overused
- Will probably replace completely traditional investment rounds

#Conclusion
- Always ask the question "If I'm not paying for it, who is paying?"
- Today, the challenge seems to be very similar for proprietary software
