Research and selection of the project :

I never really used open source programmes  and i never really looked for it. So starting this project i asked myself "What are the projects i already know in the languages i can work with? " .
I then thought about project such as LibreOffice and RubyOnRails. Unfortunately both are really big project and not very beginner friendly due to their size and their complexity.
I then searched on on githhub pages that gathers Good First issues for new projects. i found two projects called strongbox and Chatwoot, but i eventually dropped both of them because their
communities were either very active or the project in itself was too complex to install and run and the documentation was poor. I then heard from a friend about the project
https://github.com/Just-A-Visitor/Algorithmic-Pseudocode and decided to contribute to it. The project as an educative purpose and aims to gather algorithms to help people prepare interviews,
students and people competing in algorithm contests.

Contributions:

I looked at the open issues and i found the issue https://github.com/Just-A-Visitor/Algorithmic-Pseudocode/issues/18 . I then searched on the net how topological sorting works and i found khan's
algorithm than fit the requirements of the issue and that is easy to understand. I then proposed the algorithm with a pull request (https://github.com/Just-A-Visitor/Algorithmic-Pseudocode/pull/77) 
and since i copy/pasted the pseudo-code on wikipedia, i made a personal contribution by providing an example to explain step by step how the algorithm works. I then had multiple exchanges with the 
owner of the repo about changes i had to make on the pseudo-code to match the format of the other algorithm on the repo and change the pseudo code from a verbose format to a more code-like format 
and give a more detailed version of the arc suppression inside the algorithm to avoid time complexity explosion.
After these changes and with the help of the owner my pull request got merged. What i learned from this project is the importance of documentation, guidelines and complete tutorials to allow people 
*to easily understand the code and contribute to it. i also discovered a little bit about the open source community and how it works but i can't say i have discovered everything just by looking at 
three different project. I also discovered that there are lots of really interesting projects out there that deserves more attention and help.
