## Introduction

I was pretty new to Github and the open source environment. 
Naturally, the first thing I did was to look at different projects, to see if any would catch my attention. 
Since I didn’t know what I was looking for, I decided to look at unsolved issues on github.  

## First Contribution 

For my first contribution, I wanted to join a beginner friendly community.
I looked for projects with issues labeled : "good-first-issue".

After few hours, I managed to find a good beginner friendly project : the Hacktoberfest 2021 [https://github.com/dscmbcet/hacktoberfest-2021], which is specially made for beginners on github. 
There is a strong active community, ready to help open source beginners.

I made my first contribution (pretty simple) : I had to print prime numbers from a lower bound to an upper bound, using for loops. 

After asking some questions to one contributor about the community, the project and pulling requests, my work got merged. 
This gave me a much needed first approach of the open source community. 

## Second Contribution

Then I started to look for another project to contribute. 

Since I wanted to do some Python, I found a project about building a Python package for colored strings in Python. 
There was one contributor to this project. Luckily (for me), he had some issues, so I started to talk about the project with him. 
I asked for assignement on an issue, which was about printing strings in different colors (rainbow, random, character by character...). 

I asked him to clarify what he needed, and what I needed to do, so I could start to work on the issue. 
I made my pull request, but sadly my modifications are still not merged.

## Conclusion

The most difficult part was having a good grasp on the Github tool. The very beginning is kind of rough. 
However, making my first pull request getting merged was quite satisfying. 
Additionnaly, contribution to small projects is something I find interesting. You can easily get along with the contributor(s), and keep helping frequently.
Why not to keep in touch with the Python package project ?
