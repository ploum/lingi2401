This guy had modified the software on the previous printer so you were notified when your print was done (because most people worked on a different floor than the printer). He realised he could not do it anymore with the new printer because the software was copyrighted and no source code were available.

# What is freedom?
Free to use your own definition of freedom

#Open Source Initiative
- Eric Raymond and Bruce Perens

#Open Source philosophy
- Open Source is the best way to develop complex software
- It's the only way for really complex software
- The Cathedral and the Bazaar

---
class: center, middle
# Free Software vs Open Source
- Free software because it's better for humans, even if software are less good.
- Open source because it's better for software development. 

- Free software won't compromise. Non-free software are to be avoided.
- Open source looks for compromises and may even help proprietary software.
